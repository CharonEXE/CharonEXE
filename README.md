👋 Hi, I’m @CharonEXE
👀 I’m interested in lot of different things and struggling to focus on one.
🌱 I’m currently learning Rust right now and seeking to grow my career path out of it.
‍💻 I'm currently working on my react-chess program.
💞️ I’m looking to work and learn with you all.

Striking for the best in me as Software Developer.
